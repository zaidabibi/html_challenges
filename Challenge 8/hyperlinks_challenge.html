       <p>On the 23rd of March 2018 I started a 6 months coding caused , aimed to empower me and to tackle in equality on the Cape Flats .</p>
       <p> The journey to self discovery and the power of the mind all started in my first lesson , and if I could take anything from that lesson it would be to be open to learning and to apply myself effectively </p>
       <br>
       <p> Everything from headings to forming a table inside a table has been challenging , but refreshing and has only made me feel like nothing is impossible if you apply yourself.</p>
       <p> Since the start of this module I have learnt how to interpret most of the HTML language and how it is used in order to provide structure to a webpage.</p>
       <p>It has been challenging because it is something entirely new to adapt to but it has also been a huge learning curve.</p>
       <p> I have learnt that tags are very important and it serves a specific purpose , it also identifies with where everythingis displayed and how. </p>
       <p> I have learnt that you as an individual need to decide whether or not you want to apply yourself.</p>
